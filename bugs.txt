* ExternalProcessTask waits indefinitely if the process waits for more input. It should close the process' stdin.

* A lot of old features of STG plugin need to reappear:

** The transition text should be appropriate.
** The selected nodes properties should appear in the property editor.
** The arcs should point towards the centers of the transition labels.
** The hit test should prioritise the transitions/places over the arcs.
** Double click on the transition should allow editing its label.
** Simulation tool should reappear.
** Node creation tools should not show blank screen.
** The selected nodes should be highlighted.
** The node grouping should become possible.
** The components being hovered over while connecting should be highlighted.
** The names of new places and transitions should be generated ensuring no name clashes happen.
** The name clashing introduced by user should be handled in some way: either forbid it entirely or fix it when exporting to .g (alerting the user).
** Connecting implicit place and a transition should be allowed.
** Save/load should be supported
** Layout plugins should be supported
